What is consistent through my different career paths is my desire to make a difference or some social impact, and at the very least being of service to others through my work or activities.  When I was pursuing medicine as a premed, I found passion in my volunteer work, often interacting with patients in clinical research or being Big Brother for children living with HIV at a nursing facility, and while I was still in that path, the pursuit of medicine was a means to impact some social good.  When I was on the test prep and consulting path, I found passion eventually working with underrepresented populations to equalize access to resources like my work at Mentoring In Medicine.  On a more individual level, helping a student understand the way I understood Physics on a conceptual and academic level was uber rewarding.  

It is with the same spirit and philosophy that I foray into the data science field. I am looking to pursue opportunities or activities to apply my data science skills for some positive social impact.  As a neophyte in the field, I can only give back to the community by writing blogs on Medium since I always appreciated others on Medium providing a comprehensive and thorough explanation, as well as an easy to understand walkthrough of any particular process, so that is my contribution for now.

My experience at the Flatiron Online Immersive Data Science Bootcamp has only taught me that there is so much more to learn in my data science journey.  Flatiron has provided me the keys to the big candy store of data science skills, and I am excited at the prospect of the delicious and delectable but uphill journey as I have only tasted a few flavors of Jelly Belly at this point and scratched the surface in terms of mastery and knowledge.  

As such, I am always seeking for feedback on how to be a better practitioner, as well as seeking opportunities to challenge myself to improve on existing and to learn new skills as a data scientist. I am always on the quest for better explanations, insights, and solutions with the goal of being able to impart that knowledge for someone else in the same journey by getting involved in hackathons, conferences, and such.
