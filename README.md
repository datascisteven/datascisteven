## ðŸ‘‹  Thanks for visiting my Github page.

What is consistent through my different paths to find a career is my desire to make a difference or some social impact, but at the very least being able to help others along the way through my work.  When I was pursuing medicine as a premed, I found passion in my volunteer work, often interacting with patients, such as being Big Brother for children living with HIV at a nursing facility, and while I was still in that path, the pursuit of medicine was a means to impact some social good.  When I was pursuing test prep, I found passion in interaction with students and working with underrepresented populations to equalize access to resources like my work at Mentoring In Medicine.  On a more individual level, helping a student understand the way I understood Physics on a conceptual and academic level was super rewarding.  It is with that same spirit that I am looking to pursue opportunities or activities to apply my data science skills for positive social impact.  As a neophyte in the field, I can give back to the community by writing blogs on Medium since I always appreciated whenever anyone on Medium provided a thorough explanation and an easier to understand walkthrough of any particular process, so that is my goal.

My experience at the Flatiron Online Immersive Data Science Bootcamp has only taught me that there is so much more to learn in my data science journey.  Flatiron has provided me the key to the big candy store of data science skills, and I am excited at the prospect of the delicious and delectable but uphill journey as I have only scratched the surface in terms of mastery and knowledge.  As such, I am always seeking for feedback on how to be a better practitioner, as well as seeking opportunities to challenge myself by improving on existing and learning new skills as a data scientist. I am always on the quest for better explanations, insights, and solutions, and always looking to learn by teaching or imparting any knowledge or experience for someone else in the data science journey.  I will seek employment opportunities that allow me the opportunity to continue my learning in data science, as well as getting involved in outside projects like hackathons and such.
