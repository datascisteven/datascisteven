ðŸ‘‹  Thanks for visiting my Github page.

As a recent graduate of the Flatiron Online Immersive Data Science Bootcamp, the experience has taught me that I am only scratching the surface in terms of my data science knowledge.  I am always seeking for feedback on how to be a better practitioner, as well as seeking opportunities to continue challenging my current and learning new hard skills as a data scientist.  As a holdover from my MCAT days, I also believe in equalizing access to resources for anyone interested in taking the data science journey.  It is with that spirit I write my blogs on Medium since I always appreciated whenever anyone on Medium provided a thorough explanation and an easier to understand walkthrough of any particular process.

Being academically oriented and being a teacher at my very core, I am always on the quest for better explanations, insights, and solutions, and always looking to learn by teaching or imparting any knowledge or experience for someone else in the data science journey.  In the same vein, I will always remain thirsty for knowledge as a lifetime learner, always seeking feedback on how to become a better practitioner.
